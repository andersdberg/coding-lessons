## Lessons

### Lesson 1: Prerequisite knowledge

Lesson 1 requires that you trust the process. You will be learning a lot of topics that seem disconnected. And individually, they are not very exciting or powerful. However, these tools are the foundation for everything else that you'll be doing in this course. You will not master them in Lesson 1, but you will learn what they are used for and how to use them. You will become increasingly proficient with these tools as the lessons progress. These tools are equivalent to learning how to use a wrench, screwdiver, etc.
