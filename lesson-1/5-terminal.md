# Terminal

On MacOS, you can use the `Terminal` program to open a terminal that gives you access to the command line interface (CLI).

TODO: include Windows terminal documentation

Within VSC, you can open a terminal with ``cmd + ` ``, or navigate to the toolbar and select `Terminal -> New Terminal`.

A terminal is a text representation of the operating system. Meaning, you can navigate the file system, open files, edit files, open programs, etc. The GUI (graphical user interface) of the operating system is not necessary for web servers as it uses a lot of resources (Memory and Compute or CPU). Servers that are running software, only have the minimum required software to execute your code. This is for cost savings, it is for increase performance, and it is for increase security as the less software running on a machine the fewer attack surfaces there are.

## Activities

- What is a terminal, describe it.

## Notes
- Navigating the OS
    - `pwd` - present working directory; shows what directory you are currently in, usually your home directory
    - `ls` - list the files and directories in the present working directory.
        - `ls -al` will list hidden files (those that start with a period `.`) and will also show ownership, size, modification date, and file type. The reason why hidden files are important in software development, is because a lot of configuration files are hidden.
    - `cd <directory>` - change directory
- Running commands
- etc.
