# Getting Started

Google and YouTube are your friend. It is important to understand that professional developers use these tools very frequently (multiple times per day - sometimes the majority of the day). Being a professional developer is more about knowing _how to_ find information than it is memorizing. Technology changes daily, and complex systems include many third-party libraries. Nobody is expected to memorize or understand the inner-workings of everything.

If at any point in these lessons you need help or clarification, your first go-to for help should be Google and YouTube. Get comfortable learning how to learn, asking the right questions, etc.
