# Text Editor

A text editor is where you will be viewing and editing code. A text editor can be something as simple as the default `TextEdit` on MacOS, or Notepad on Windows. It is important that the text editor that you select produces _plain text_. Programs like Microsoft Word do not save plain text.

In addition to simple text editors, there are Integrated Development Environments or an IDE. An IDE includes helpful features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and more to assist in development. For this course we reccomend using an IDE. 

A popular choice, which is also free, is Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (VSC). At the time of writing (Fall 2022) 36.86% of developers use VSC which can be [downloaded here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). VSC can be used to write code in any language for any platform.

Documentation for how to use VSC can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs). You do not need to know all of the options and features of VSC to get started. However, there are a lot of features and plugins (mods) that extend it's capabilities and provide additional assistance in writing better code, deploying the code to servers, running tests, etc. For now, opening and editing files is all that you need to be able to do.

Activities:
- Download and install VSC
- Open VSC
- Open a folder/directory
- Create a file
- Save it

## Notes 
- Include example of MS word document _inside_ of a text editor.
- Macos textedit is not good either
